Simple podcast generator demo with following steps:  
-metadata (LLM)  
-dialog simulation (via AutoGen)  
-dialog refining (LLM)  
-speech generation (OpenAI or ElevenLabs)  
-ambient audio planning (LLM)  
-ambient audio generation (Replicate)  
-audio processing (FFMpeg)

Usage: After installing required libraries, create .env with valid keys for OpenAI/Anthropic and ElevenLabs, edit "params.py" (e.g., models, background data, host, topic), then run run "podcast_generator.py".

Currently set for Finnish content with OpenAI/Anthropic or local LLM. For ElevenLabs, you need to specify speakers that LLM can select from (with supported language). These are hardcoded in "podcast_generator.py".
Additional example outputs in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IxK3AM9hqq6yu_xEGQctUjRaO1Iu-JRU.

Note: All content are automatically generated by LLM using public data only. Factual content in output files is not vefified and mentions to any real persons/companies could be completely made up (by LLM).
